# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Features in the application include all of the buttons on the main page that either let you see a different 'page' view, create new random posters, and save posters that you may especially like and want to see later. 
You can create your own poster - all criteria must be filled out to do so, or you will receive an error message.
You are able to delete 'unmotivational posters' if you're not into that kind of thing.
In the 'saved posters' view, you are able to click on a saved poster and view it in larger size. I also played around with localeStorage, so for saved posters in particular, if you refresh the page, the saved posters will remain there. You can delete these posters if you change your mind and don't want them there. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
To get this app running, they have to go to the github repo, clone it to their device, and open it using 'open index.html'

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off. gifs preferred!)
While it might not be the most 'impressive' piece of functionality, I'm very amused and pleased with my localStorage saving my array of saved posters, and being able to see them be present, or see them get deleted in real time.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We had about a week and a half to complete this project. I was able to complete it, with some extensions withing 3-4 daysl. I am currently repeating the 2nd Module.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
I believe the learning goals of this project were to get more hands on experience/practice with html, javascript, and css. I think this project is a great introduction to getting comfortable with all of those aspects. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The wins I had for this project personally was 1. completing it in a timely fashion, since the first time I did this project it did take me the whole week and a half to complete. 2. was actually having the time to do more with it and add some extensions and additional functionality. I can't honestly say that I had challenges with this project this time around.
